Considering all interactions through single set of abstractions instead of each module repeating
these with some common interfaces.

Common to all actions available to player:

- visibility – should the player know about the action
- availability – should the player be able to perform the action

Does this cover *all* possible interactions? Consider other kinds of input, like free text, mouse, 
or gamepad movement.
