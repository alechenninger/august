TODO:

- [ ] UI and abstractions for saving/loading/pausing/starting. UI work means might want to look at
  longer term UI plans (below).
- [ ] Flutter-based UI ... or use react/patternfly? (would that be weird?)
- [ ] Module development (finish prompt, inventory, locations, ...)
- [ ] Remote UI (client-server)
- [ ] null safety
